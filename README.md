## 🧐 [About](#about)

This application is a simple analogue to the basic <b>Sign In</b> funtionality that we come accross in various websites or apps, where the user is prompted to enter his/her general details and some sort of authentication is done at the backend to ensure only safe and secure users access the app, as well as the sign in details of the user is safe with the app.

<br>

## 🖥️ [Frontend](#frontend) 

The frontend has been created using <b>HTML and CSS</b>. It contains a Sign In page where users have to input their name, email and a password. This data is utilised at the backend for authentication using an <i>API key</i> (mailed to the user during user creation) and on successful authentication, the users are directed to a success page.

<br>

## 🚀 [Backend](#backend) 

The backend is curated using <b>JavaScript</b> on <b>NodeJS</b> runtime environment, and the database used to store the user details is <b>MongoDB</b> (noSQL database).

As a user inputs his details, the details get stored into mongodb database. The backend then creates an API key for the users and mails the key to the email ID provided for sign in. This API key is then used for authentication during further login attempts by the particular user.
